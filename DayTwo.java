/* Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest
 * way down to the coast from here is via toboggan.
 * 
 * The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad
 * day. "Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!" You ask if
 * you can take a look.
 *
 * Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the 
 * passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate
 * Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.
 *
 * To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input)
 * of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate 
 * policy when that password was set.
 *
 * For example, suppose you have the following list:
 * 1-3 a: abcde
 * 1-3 b: cdefg
 * 2-9 c: ccccccccc
 *
 * Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password
 * policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter
 * must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that
 * the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.
 *
 * In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg,
 * is not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1. The first
 * and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within
 * the limits of their respective policies.
 *
 *
 * How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
 *
 *--- Part Two ---
 *
 * While it appears you validated the passwords correctly, they don't seem
 * to be what the Official Toboggan Corporate Authentication System is
 * expecting.
 *
 * The shopkeeper suddenly realizes that he just accidentally explained the
 * password policy rules from his old job at the sled rental place down the
 * street! The Official Toboggan Corporate Policy actually works a little
 * differently.
 *
 * Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1
 * means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on. (Be
 * careful; Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!)
 * Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter. Other
 * occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy
 * enforcement.
 *
 * Given the same example list from above:
 * 1-3 a: abcde is valid: position 1 contains a and position 3 does not.
 * 1-3 b: cdefg is invalid: neither position 1 nor position 3 contains b.
 * 2-9 c: ccccccccc is invalid: both position 2 and position 9 contain c.
 *
 * How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?
